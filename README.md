Bayside Vinyl is a passion project of mine. A web app intended to serve as the launching point for Bayside Vinyl and it's various offshoots. The app gives the visitor an idea of what the Bayside Vinyl is and what it can become. The goal is to convey the value of having a record store in the heart of Brickell, as well as, display the "complex simplicity" of the app itself. On the surface, Bayside Vinyl looks quite simple in terms of design. However, it took a fair amount of CSS3 styling (along with Ruby/HTML5 coding) to create the apps overall design. This entire project was built with Ruby on Rails.


Features:
* The additions of users, as well as, mp3 playback were both implemented with Ruby code.

* Bayside Vinyl uses Heroku (w/Postgres) to hold the web app itself.

* A repurposed jPlayer media player was used to play Bayside Vinyl's uploaded MP3s.

* Amazon Web Services hosts the MP3s and track artwork

* All images (and logos) used in the app design were created via photoshop.

* The entire app uses the Bootstrap framework  to hold everything together
