      <h2 class="featurette-heading">What is Bayside Vinyl? <span class="text-muted">It's a proposed record store for the Brickell (Downtown Miami) area.</span></h2>

      <p class="homeparagraph">Bayside Vinyl is an idea that I have had for about 8 years now. I picked up an affinity for vinyl records through my love for sample-based music.
                               There are not many record stores in Miami and certainly not the Downtown/Brickell area. I would love to have the opportunity to change that.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Why Brickell City Centre? <span class="text-muted">It's the newest mall in the area and it is adding new stores everyday.</span></h2>
      <p class="homeparagraph">The experience of going into a store and buying physical copies of
        various forms of media has changed. People are more likely to just stream their content. However, vinyl has consistently had a <a class="linkvinyl" href="http://consequenceofsound.net/2017/01/vinyl-on-track-to-become-a-billion-dollar-industry-in-2017/">yearly resurgence</a>.
        In fact, there are even <a class="linkvinyl" href="http://thevinylfactory.com/features/the-8-best-vinyl-subscription-services-to-help-grow-your-record-collection/">subscription services</a> for vinyl now.
        The idea of actually having a modern day record store is what drew me to Brickell City Centre. There is no better time to dive into the world of vinyl than right now for both collectors and sellers.

      <p class="homeparagraph">Well, this page actually serves as the central hub for anything connected to the Bayside Vinyl brand.
                               As of right now, the hit-or-miss vinyl selector app is available to use. However, there are plans to expand the brand in a plethora of ways.</p>
